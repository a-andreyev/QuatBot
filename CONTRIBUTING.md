# Contributing to QuatBot

Welcome to QuatBot! We're happy you would like to add something to it.
Pull Requests (PRs) are always welcome: you don't need to ask if you
are allowed to fix something. It may be worthwhile to open a PR early
(before it's done or even before any work is done) to discuss a
new feature.

## Coding Style

QuatBot uses automated formatting tools. Feel free to write your code
any way you like, but please apply the tools before pushing to a PR:

- clang-format13 and the associated `.clang-format` file for C++
- gersemi for CMake
